# 16 July 2025
The Honorable Avinash Ramtohul, Minister of Information Technology, Communication and
Innovation, Republic of Mauritius
African Network Information Center (AFRINIC)
℅ Mr. Gowtamsingh Dabee, FCCA ADIT MBA, Appointed Receiver
Re: ICANN’s Open Letter to the Mauritius Minister of Information Technology,
Communication and Innovation and the Court-Appointed Receiver over AFRINIC, Mr.
Gowtamsingh Dabee
Dear Your Excellency and Mr. Dabee,
ICANN writes in its capacity as the nonprofit organization charged with ensuring the stable and
secure operation of the Internet's unique identifier systems, and in this regard, coordinates the
allocation and assignment at the top-most level of Internet Protocol numbers and Autonomous
System numbers. In this role, ICANN is responsible for recognizing the Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs), including AFRINIC, which ICANN recognized on 8 April 2005 as the RIR for the
region of Africa and the Indian Ocean.
ICANN is also responsible for confirming that RIRs maintain compliance with the obligations
within ICP:2: Criteria for Establishment of New Regional Registries. AFRINIC’s compliance
requirements are set forward in the Implementation and Assessment Procedures for ICP-2
Compliance document.1
ICANN communicates from our role as the accrediting organization of AFRINIC to perform its
function as an RIR. ICANN previously offered neutral and independent assistance to the Official
Receiver appointed over AFRINIC, Mr. V. Virasamy at his request, and made the same offer to
the current court-appointed Receiver, Mr. Gowtamsingh Dabee, upon his appointment. We have
also been communicating with Mr. Dabee to explain ICANN’s role on the global Internet and in its
official capacity as designated by the global Internet Community.
ICANN has recently communicated with AFRINIC formally through its Court Appointed Receiver,
Mr. Dabee, via letters on 25 June 2025 and on 3 July 2025, requesting full response to the
questions posed about the conduct relating to the recent effort to hold elections. We provide those
letters as attachments to this open letter.
Mr. Dabee, in response to the 25 June 2025 letter, provided a letter with enumerated responses
to each question posed. However, the content of those responses was sparse, offering few details
and instead suggesting that no further detail was needed about the annulled election because the
election was annulled. In response to the 3 July 2025 letter, the Receiver has provided ICANN
1 As discussed in the ICANN Board’s rationale supporting the ratification of the Implementation and Assessment
Procedures, those procedures were developed in coordination with RIRs after the Address Supporting Organization’s
Address Council initiated work to develop an implementation document.

with a few short notes acknowledging the letter, though AFRINIC has not yet provided any further
detail as requested.
We do not attach Mr. Dabee’s letters as he has requested that we not publish his responses. We
requested a full response by Mr. Dabee to the questions by 8 July 2025 but have not received any
further details in response.
ICANN reminds Mr. Dabee that AFRINIC, as one of the five RIRs, sits in a position of public trust
to properly manage the numbering resources that have been allocated to the African region.
Those numbering resources are provided for the benefit of the global Internet community and the
region served by AFRINIC. Those numbering resources are not assets of AFRINIC (nor any other
RIR). In fact, the value of the RIR is in its distribution of those resources in accordance with the
local policies governing that allocation.2 The RIR function of distributing resources cannot be used
to act for the benefit or protection of a single creditor, member, or group of members. Mr. Dabee
confirmed his understanding of this during a 16 May 2025 telephone call with ICANN staff.
ICANN’s primary objective has been and remains for AFRINIC to be a well-governed RIR
functioning in compliance with ICP-2. As we’ve discussed within our letters to the Receiver, there
are many facets to ICP-2 compliance.
As it relates to maintaining the support of members and treating members equitably, AFRINIC has
not yet provided any meaningful response on the issues of perceptions of outsized influence of
certain members, on perceptions of unequal access to information, and the other issues detailed
in my prior letters. ICANN reiterates that the fact that the election was annulled does not moot the
need for a full, public evaluation of how AFRINIC reached that point, and how a renewed election
will avoid the same pitfalls. AFRINIC’s continued silence on the factors that led to the annulment
of the election and its intention to press forward to hold a new election without any meaningful
analysis of what went wrong (and right) with the annulled nomination and election process
previously convened, remains problematic.
AFRINIC has also not yet provided confirmation of the status of AFRINIC’s record keeping and
backups, which Mr. Dabee indicated on 26 June 2025 that he was researching and would follow-
up. It has now been over two weeks without further information.
ICANN noted with interest Mr. Dabee’s 9 July 2025 Advisory on third-party communications.
ICANN has also heard similar reports regarding the solicitation of broad power of attorney
documents from AFRINIC members. When viewed in light of the powers associated to members
within the AFRINIC Bylaws, the Receiver’s encouragement to “[c]arefully review any requests
2 While each RIR receives allocations of IPv4 address space from IANA, that RIR’s role in respect
to those addresses is to support the management and public distribution of that public Internet
address space within the RIR’s region. See https://afrinic.net/library/126-policy-ipv4-address-
allocation-policies. For IPv6 address space, AFRINIC’s policies clearly state “IPv6 address space
is a public resource that must be managed in a prudent manner with regards to the long-term
interests of the Internet.” https://afrinic.net/policy/archive/ipv6-addressallocation-and-assignment-
policy-afpub-2013-v6-001.

involving the signing of a PoA or similar documents that may assign decision-making authority to
another entity” cannot be stressed enough. Under the AFRINIC Bylaws, the AFRINIC
membership holds significant rights to take decisions about AFRINIC beyond voting in elections,
and in ways that could minimize the import of or otherwise interfere with the Board of Directors
elections. ICANN joins the Receiver’s note of caution.
Allegations that ICANN has misrepresented reporting from a media outlet funded by the CEO of
an AFRINIC resource member, Cloud Innovation Ltd (Cloud), are baseless. ICANN urges
AFRINIC resource members to scrutinize sources carefully—especially when an outlet claiming to
be ‘unbiased’ publishes over 50 AFRINIC-related articles in two weeks and solicits members to
use the Number Resource Society (NRS) to ‘organize your [AFRINIC] election activity’.
NRS also has direct ties to Cloud’s CEO and has taken controversial positions that explicitly
advocate for treating IP address blocks as owned assets in direct contrast to formal AFRINIC
policies, seeking to establish legal deeds of property for IP resources. ICANN recognized
AFRINIC for the purpose of distributing numbering resources to the African and Indian Ocean
region for use in that region. By applying needs-based allocation, and rules that support that,
AFRINIC distributes numbering resources to organizations and operators in the region that
actually need them to deploy networks and services in Africa. This discourages speculation and
hoarding by private actors and encourages access to Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
enterprises and community networks across Africa. ICANN is very concerned that certain entities
may be seeking to use the current governance crisis to try to capture AFRINIC for their own
personal gain against the well-established allocation methods that are consistent across RIRs.
ICANN also is aware that Cloud, as a single resource member of AFRINIC, announced on 11 July
2025 that it has unilaterally applied to the Mauritius Court to dissolve AFRINIC as a corporate
entity. The Receiver confirmed this in a 14 July 2025 Communiqué, noting only the fact of filing,
the date for AFRINIC’s return, and that the Receiver is proceeding with the elections. Cloud has
stated its belief that this action is in the” best interest of the African Internet community” and under
the guise of the protection of the African Internet community. To the more than 2000 other
resource members of AFRINIC, we urge you to meet the challenge that is being posed to your
entity and consider who is authorized to act on your behalf. To Mr. Dabee, we demand the
immediate issuance of a further communiqué to the AFRINIC membership about the particulars of
the dissolution application.
Though Cloud suggests that moving to dissolve AFRINIC is aligned with ICANN’s requests,
ICANN wishes to make clear that nothing could be further from the truth. As ICANN has
repeatedly urged, free and fair elections within which all eligible AFRINIC resource members have
the opportunity to knowingly and meaningfully participate have been and remain possible. A duly
elected Board that can act on behalf of an engaged membership should be the body that acts on
behalf of AFRINIC.
The Renewed Elections—Ideas for Paths Forward
ICANN reiterates its call for free and fair elections that are appropriately designed to seat a
quorate AFRINIC Board.

We also acknowledge receipt of Mr. Dabee’s request3 for ICANN’s assistance surrounding the
nomination committee for the election of future AFRINIC Board of Directors. Mr. Dabee has not
yet provided ICANN with any particulars of what assistance he is requesting. ICANN offers this
public letter identifying some ideas of what a full and fair election, designed to restore confidence
in the process and outcomes, could look like. These are ideas based on our current
understanding of the situation, guided by the Bylaws and past precedent, and should not be
considered as a directive to AFRINIC.
ICANN notes that on 15 July 2025, Mr. Dabee issued a Notice regarding the annulled elections
and proceeding to new elections for the AFRINIC Board of Directors.4 The annulled AFRINIC
elections still need to be looked at in full to identify opportunities for meaningful mitigation of the
issues within that process. Taking stock, here is a bullet-point listing of some of the events
surrounding the annulled election, many of which have been highlighted by AFRINIC members
themselves:
● An April 2025 announcement of the Nomination Committee without any representation
from the AFRINIC region.
● A late April 2025 discovery that Cloud was entered on the AFRINIC corporate record (the
only Resource Member to be so named) - an issue that was not remedied until June, while
the status of Cloud’s related claims against AFRINIC still remains unclear.
● Concerns raised by some of the AFRINIC membership regarding the challenges to
register to vote.
● The impact of allowing unlimited power-of-attorney documents to be presented onsite,
despite the fact that members themselves are only allowed to carry five proxies.
● The discovery of at least one unauthorized power-of-attorney document and police
reporting on the incident.
● A declaration of suspension of the election that was lifted hours later and without notice;
● The announcement of an annulment of the election.
● The announcement of an extension of mandate without any information on the supporting
application or court order.
It is time to build a productive path forward with the AFRINIC community to make sure the
members’ concerns are answered and trust is rebuilt. Here are ideas on how to do that:
Restore Member Trust: As preparatory work, there appears to be a variety of actions that could
provide the AFRINIC membership with information and access that they lacked in the stalled
election, including:
● Providing the AFRINIC community a publicly available forum to share concerns about
processes as previously announced and ideas for remediation.
3 ICANN notes with disappointment that Mr. Dabee has not informed ICANN about the application for
AFRINIC’s dissolution, though he followed up as recently as 11 July 2025 regarding his request for
assistance.
4 Within that Notice, the Receiver confirms that there was more than one power of attorney at issue within the annulled
election (“suspicions of irregularities were raised, particularly regarding the use of Powers of Attorney by some voters”)
and claims that he is unable to formally report on the “extent of the identified irregularities”.

● Releasing a full report of the investigation that was conducted on the issues within the
June 2025 election.
● Publishing clarifying information on the status of AFRINIC’s litigation document, including
the status of Cloud’s claims against AFRINIC, any pending applications or requests in
those matters, and your understanding of whether the Receiver’s non-objection in the April
2025 application by Cloud resolved the issue of whether Cloud is able to maintain the
resources previously allocated by AFRINIC.
● Publishing information about the contents of and the basis for the Receiver’s application to
seek an extension of their mandate and the contents of the court order on that extension.
● Initiating (and maintain throughout the election process) a regular cadence of public
communication to the AFRINIC membership (for example, once a week) on progress and
status. As part of this communication, commit to providing clear identification and
justification for when the renewed election process deviates from the AFRINIC Bylaws.
● Committing that any person or entity that the Receiver will bring in to support the election
process will provide a publicly available declaration of non-affiliation (personal,
professional, financial) with any litigant against AFRINIC or entity promoting participation
in the AFRINIC election; and without any other interest that may affect the individual’s
interest on any matters to be considered by AFRINIC.
Set AFRINIC Up for Future Success: Before renewing the work on nominations and election
processes, the scope and definition of the terms of seats available for election could be revisited.
The AFRINIC Bylaws set out that the terms of the eight elected directors are staggered across a
three-year period. In the annulled election, all eight seats were proposed for election for three-
year terms, thereby setting AFRINIC up for an election in three-year’s time when the Bylaws again
cannot be followed. The renewal of the election process offers an opportunity to elect directors to
terms that will re-start the expected rotation. For example only5:
● The election for Directors representing Northern Africa (Seat 1) and Western Africa (Seat
2) as well as one region-independent director (Seat 7), for one-year terms (ending at the
AGMM 2026);
● The election for Directors representing the Indian Ocean (Seat 3) and Central Africa (Seat
4), as well as one region-independent director (Seat 8), for two-year terms (ending at the
AGMM 2027); and
● The election for Directors representing Southern Africa (Seat 5) and Eastern Africa (Seat
6) for three-year terms (ending at the AGMM 2028).
Seek Independent Expertise in Election Design: Particularly in light of the questions
surrounding the annulled process, consider the appointment of an expert in election design to
complete the design of the renewed process. Any appointed expert should provide a publicly
available declaration of non-affiliation, as described above.
5 There are other possibilities for how a rotation could be renewed.

Define “Member in Good Standing” for Nomination and Voting Purposes: Any member that
is implicated in obtaining proxies or power-of-attorney documents that were disavowed or
identified as not valid should be removed from eligibility in making nominations and voting. The
member’s ability to maintain resources/membership can be reserved for discussion with future
Board/CEO.
Nomination Process: Potential changes that could support a free and fair election could include:
● Confirm that a reconstituted Nominating Committee includes representatives from the
African continent.
● Require all Nominating Committee members to post public declarations of non-affiliation.
● Reopen the nomination process for candidates after the Nomination Committee sets
qualifications.
● Require all candidates to make publicly available a statement of interest identifying the
person or entity nominating them; whether they have any personal, professional, financial
or arrangement with any other person or entity in relation to their candidacy or service on
the Board, if elected; identification of any other interests that may affect the candidate’s
judgment on any matters to be considered by AFRINIC.
● Consider the use of candidate interviews or comment periods regarding candidates, which
are tools available under the Bylaws and prior Election Processes.
Voting Process: ICANN understands that the Receiver is already considering whether any form
of in-person voting is necessary, or if electronic voting is sufficient. Assuming that AFRINIC will
return to an all e-voting position, some safeguards could include:
● Engaging with other RIRs, electronic voting providers, and other membership
organizations to identify their mechanisms for the validation of voting rights, including
maintenance of clear records of which role or individual is authorized to vote on behalf of
each resource member.
● Establishing a complaint mechanism to understand AFRINIC member voter
validation/registration challenges.
● Identifying paths for fixing registration challenges and timeframe for updating registration.
Holding the Election: The independent election expert can design proper oversight and maintain
an observation role over the electronic system for the election. If any changes to the announced
timeline and process are required, commit to provide documentation and explanation to the
community regarding such a change, and with proper notice. For example, a pause in voting
might be achieved on an emergency basis, but a restarting of paused voting might require some
period of notice to allow the members the ability to exercise their voting rights.
As ICANN is not a membership-based organization nor an expert in elections, we stress that the
notes above are offered as ideas, and hope that they might be a helpful point of reference for
AFRINIC’s continued engagement with the AFRINIC membership on these matters.

ICANN’s Next Steps
ICANN continues to reserve all rights to initiate a compliance review of AFRINIC regarding
areas of potential material non-compliance with ICP-2, without limitation. ICANN also reiterates
that the Receiver remains on notice that he, and all others acting on his behalf or AFRINIC’s behalf,
are to diligently retain and scrupulously preserve all documentation, electronic records,
communications, data, and any other relevant materials pertaining to these issues, and indeed the
entirety of the election process, without exception, in anticipation of a formal compliance review.
Failure to preserve such records will be viewed as a serious impediment to any future review and
an indication of non-cooperation.
As it relates to the newly filed application for dissolution of AFRINIC ICANN remains concerned that
this is the latest effort of a single member to try to obtain control of AFRINIC for its own commercial
interests. ICANN demands that the Receiver for AFRINIC immediately update ICANN on the status
of AFRINIC’s backups, as requested on 25 June 2025, and immediately respond to ICANN’s
questions regarding the escrow of registration data, included within ICANN’s 3 July 2025 letter.
ICANN requests the Receiver to provide all further information in response to this lett
